# Motion-Detection-Stick
The project host my senior project for completing Bachelors Degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering at Ko√ß University


The aim of this project is to create a stick that can capture the movement without need
of any other device aside from stick itself. Since it uses bluetooth signals, it can be used it 
without need of any internet wireless signal.


Motion detection stick is a device which can capture the motion. 

By recognized gestures and predefined motions, one will able to control the some features of the computer 
such as to turn off the computer, to volume up and to switch music etc. The one can switch on/off the lights . 
Also, this stick can be used as game accessorize. One of our application is playing race-game with stick at Android devices.. 

We believe that, this stick can be used many different and beneficial areas and it is so much available 
to be improved to adapt different areas. This pen can be used with some other technologies such as 
smart house technology, virtual reality, internet of things etc.
